# CoverLetterFixer
Based on the Codecademy Search &amp; swap challenge, this program updates cover letters.

Run from terminal

Save up to 3 templates in the directory you save this program in.  Name them:
A.txt
B.txt
C.txt

In your templates:
When you want the date in your letter write Date
When you want the company you are pplying to in your letter write Company
When you want the position you are applying for in your letter write Position

The program will update those three variables in your letter and then print the letter in the terminal for you to copy/paste and save a pdf version of the letter to your desktop to attach.
